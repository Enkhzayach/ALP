# Add comments to this code to predict what it will do.
print(8 + 2)
# it will add 8+2 and get 10 

print( 8 - 2)
#substraction of the variables so we get 6 

print(8 * 2)
#multiplication of the variables so 16

print(10 / 4)
# division of numbers which is 2.5

print(10 // 4)
#//means it will give us the value of the remainder after division

# This code uses variables in place of numbers in the calculation.  Add comments to explain how it works.

num1 = 20
#num1  defines 20
num2 = 5
#num2 defines 5

result = num1 * num2
#result is the multiplication of 20 and 5 

print(result)
# print gives us the value of result

# This code uses input to assign data into a variable.  Add comments to explain how it works.
print("21")
a= "21"
b= 11
print(int(a)+b)
#a is in classification of str whereas b in the form of 'int' but different forms of variables cannot be added together so int(a) converts a into same form as b which is integer. Therefore two variables can be added
print(type(a))

num1 = int(input())
num2 = 2

result = num1 // num2

print(result)
