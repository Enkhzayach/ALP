#Predict and Run Example 1
 # Add comments to the code below to explain what it does

firstName = "Andy"


print(firstName)
#We have defined firstName as Andy so as a result we printed out Andy

#Predict and Run Example 2
 # Add comments to the code below to explain what it does

lastName = "Colley"

fullName = firstName + " " + lastName

print(fullName)
#firstName is defined as Andy and lastName is defined as Colley lastly it fullName defines firstName space and lastName there is nothing inside "" therefore it is just blank space. In the end printing fullName results Andy Colley

#Predict and Run Example 3
 # Add comments to the code below to explain what it does

print("Hello " + firstName + ". Your full name is " + fullName + ".")
#plus sign represents space between each one, each part of the sentence is separated by + signs.
