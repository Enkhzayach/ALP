### Example Code 1

fName = "Mr"
lName = "Colley"

print(fName)

# Identify a variable in the code
 # Answer: we can define the variable by any word we want as we print out the defined name we have given Mr can be defined as firstName or fname or anything as firsName or fname is printed it will give us Mr for any variables

# Identify a string in the code
 # Answer:Mr and Colley are the output as we print out the variables we have given for each one

# Line 4 is changed to lName = "Thorpe".  How does this affect the output?
 #Answer: output will be Thorpe

# Line 3 is changed to fName = "Mrs". How does this affect the output?
 # Answer Mrs


### Example Code 2

num1 = 20
num2 = 5

total1 = num1 + 15
total2 = num2 * 2
total3 = num1 - num2

print(total3)

# What will be output by the program?
 # Answer it will only print out total3 which is the substraction of num1 and num2, 20-5 which is 15


### Example Code 3

name1 = "Ross" 
name2 = "Monica" 
name3 = "Joey" 
name4 = "Rachel" 
name5 = "Chandler" 
 
print(name1 + " and " + name4) 
print(name3) 
 
name3 = "Phoebe" 
print(name1, " and ", name4)
 


# How many variables are used in the program?
 # Answer 5

# What would be the impact of changing  print(name1, " and ", name4) to print(name1, " and ", name5) ?
 # Answer: it will print out Ross  and  Chandler, since we switched name4 to name5

# What is the purpose of the '+' symbol in  print(name1, " and ", name4) 
 # Answer: + gives single space, as for , coma gives 2 blank spaces but if we want one space using , then we should type without space like print(name1," and ",name4)

# The line  print(name3) is added to the end of the code.  Explain what it will do. 
 # Answer it will not change the original name3=Joey
